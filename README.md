Repository for mgs405 system analysis and design final project. I created queries based on the following user story: 

As the owner of Spring Break 'R' Us, I want to increase profits by offering rooms to adults under the age of 21, but still manage the risk of offering those rooms. 

Acceptance Criteria
1) Available details on guests & their reservation, such as their name, age, length of stay, which room they're staying in, cost of stay, behavioral concerns, and payment risk
2) A calculated risk index that displays recommendations to management, such as whether or not to give out the room.
3) Display a potential profitability score for renting out a specific room.
